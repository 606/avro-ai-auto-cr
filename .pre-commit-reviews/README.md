# Pre-commit Reviews Directory

This directory contains automated code review results generated by GitHub Copilot during pre-commit hooks.

## Structure

- `review_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Individual file reviews from pre-commit
- `batch_review_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Batch reviews from pre-push hooks

## Configuration

Reviews are configured via `.copilot-config.json` in the repository root.

## Usage

Reviews are automatically generated when:
1. **Pre-commit**: Individual files are reviewed if they meet complexity/pattern criteria
2. **Pre-push**: Batch review when 5+ files are changed

Reviews will block commits/pushes if critical issues are found (REJECT/ВІДХИЛИТИ decision).
